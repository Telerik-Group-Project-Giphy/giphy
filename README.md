# GiphyCopy

This is a group project given to our group by Telerik Academy.
The app is a simplified version of Giphy - a website for discovering and sharing Gifs.
There are a couple different buttons that navigate you through the different 'pages' of the app.

# Trending Giphys!
'Trending Giphys!' serves as our home page. Here will be displayed the trending gifs directly from the original Giphy website.

# Favorite Gifs!
'Favorite Gifs!' is where you can find all the gifs that you have selected as favorite by clicking on the heart on the top right the desired gifs.

# Upload GIF and # Uploaded Gifs!
You can also upload a gif directly from your device by clicking on the 'choose file' button and then on 'Upload GIF'. After that you can see all the gifs that you have uploaded by clicking on the 'Uploaded Gifs!' button.

# Search
You can also find a search field and a search button, where you can find gifs related to your search input.

# Gif details
When you click on any gif you will be sent to a page containing more details regarding the selected gif such as name of the user that who uploaded the gif, the name of the gif itself and the date that it was uploaded.
